So, why is it if I launch an EC2 instance, I can't access something like the user-data and get my aws access key and secret key? I launched it, so it knows it's me. Why do I need to pass that information in?

Also, is there a place that I can check, similar to the meta-data section where I can get my account's instance limit?
