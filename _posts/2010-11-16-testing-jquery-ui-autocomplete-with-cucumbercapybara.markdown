I had been running some features that were working on older versions of cucumebr/capybara with the selenium driver which had recently broke. I was able to find a [site](http://www.aentos.com/blog/testing-ajax-autocomplete-fields-cucumber-and-capybara) that has a nice explanation of how to do it. I was already doing most of this as I had found it before, but adding this step was very helpful.
