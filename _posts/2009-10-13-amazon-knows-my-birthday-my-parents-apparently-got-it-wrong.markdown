Amazon knows what my birthday is. It's not correct, but Amazon assures me that it is.



> Hello again from Amazon.com.

First, I want to sincerely apologize again for the inconvenience you have experienced with your Prime membership.

As we discussed during our recent phone conversation, I checked with a specialist about the possibility of changing the birthday on you Prime membership.

I have confirmed that the birthday on the Prime management page is only needed when you invite someone to your Prime membership. It is not used for anything else. However, I unfortunately also found **it is not possible to change this date** at this time.

Again, I sincerely apologize for this situation.

Thank you for contacting us and we hope to see you again soon.




So, when I signed up, they didn't ask for a birthday. They decided to add one and picked a birthday for me (which might be any random date) and YOU CAN'T CHANGE IT. Seriously Amazon, WTF?

The above response makes sense if I'm some completely tech clueless person, but I know this is all in a database somewhere. Go in. Edit the record. Save. It's not that hard.

To tell me you contacted a "specialist" and they couldn't do anything makes me laugh.
