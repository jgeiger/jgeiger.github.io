Job or bonus. Pick one. There are plenty of people out there that would kill to have a job, let alone a bonus. There are hundreds of people every day being given a choice: Job or paycut. And I'll give you one guess which one they're picking.

For each person in AIG getting a bonus, publish their name, and the amount of the bonus in the NYTimes. While this wouldn't fly with a private company, it would seem that I own 80% of that company now. I feel that I should know who we're paying millions of dollars to return the biggest loss in US history...
