Health insurance companies need to be reigned in.

The fact that they can FORCE doctors into specific diagnoses is unbelievably stupid. If a patient needs an exam, you pay for the EXAM not the results. You do not dictate that you won't cover the cost if the doctor gives you a response you don't want to hear.

If enough people realized that the **insurance they pay for** doesn't cover them properly, they would stop paying those providers. Once the companies lose their income stream from upset customers, they either die or change.
