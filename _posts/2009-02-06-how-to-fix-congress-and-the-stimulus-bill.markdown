Have them vote on one item at a time. 900 pages is so large that they can insert their own bits. Nextel had the right idea with the firefighters.

I'm tired of hearing that you need to "compromise" on this stuff. As individual pieces, either you support it, or you don't. Move on to the next bit.

We'd also save a crapload of paper that they seem to be wasting trying to make their points about how big it is. If you care so much, QUIT PRINTING IT OUT.
