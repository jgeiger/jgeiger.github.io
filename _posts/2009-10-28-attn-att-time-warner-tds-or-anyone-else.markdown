> We spoke to TDS about the situation last year, and its director of legislative and public relations told us that **TDS didn't act earlier because it didn't actually know that people really, really wanted fiber**; once the referendum was a success, the company moved quickly to give people what it now knew they wanted.



I really, really, really, really want fiber to my home.

Really. Really want it.



> Even better is the price, which starts at $49.95 a month for 50Mbps fiber service without the need to buy other services.



And yes, I would like 50Mbs for $50/month.

You now know I want it, so get moving.
