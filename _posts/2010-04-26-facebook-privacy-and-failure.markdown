Hmmm. They contradict themselves...

As Facebook expands, I'm getting more concerned about the "privacy" they provide. There is more than one example of how they said they would not share information and changed the ToS to begin sharing that same information... without asking me. I don't like that. I don't have anything particularly personal up there but the idea that they just do what they want when they want doesn't sit well with me.
