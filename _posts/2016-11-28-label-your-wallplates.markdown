title: Label your wallplates with the circuit breaker number
---

I was redoing some electrical outlets and I've always had the issue with trying to determine with circuit breaker goes with which outlet. 

After finding the right breaker and making the fixes, I realized I could just use a sharpie and write the breaker number on the inside of the wallplate. Next time I need to do some work on that outlet, I'll see exactly which breaker I need to turn off.
