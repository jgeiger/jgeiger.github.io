So Landon makes some comments in a book without talking to David first. He admits bad form.

Here's where it gets dumb.



> "It's unprofessional in my eyes. In every soccer player's eyes throughout the world **it would be unprofessional to speak out about a teammate especially in the press and not to your face**," Beckham said.

"But I'm going to turn it on a positive spin because that's what this needs. But in 17 years, I have played with the biggest teams in the world and the biggest players and not once have I been criticized for my professionalism. **It's important to get this cleared up and I will be speaking to Landon either this evening or over the next couple of days.**"



So... you talked to the press before talking to him? How does that make you any different... Wow.
