Why impose fees on corporations? Consumers just get stuck with the bill anyway. Vonage emailed me a notice today.


> The Regulatory Recovery Fee will become the Regulatory and Compliance Fee, which covers **_our_** regulatory-related and legal compliance expenses. For example, this fee pays for charges associated with benefits like procedures to ensure customer privacy, identity theft protection measures and phone number porting.


If it was your cost, I wouldn't have to pay it.
