I was thinking about this last night, and Basecamp is a nice tool where people can collaborate and upload attachments, discuss, and post. This is really what Google Wave does, so once it gets out there, and into "private" wave hosts, Basecamp may have less utility.

If you think about Wave as an irc replacement, you've already got the archiving capability built in. Now, you'd need to set it up a bit differently, but now there's a record of the conversations, and ordering.

Now if only I could find the invites for other people in my account.
