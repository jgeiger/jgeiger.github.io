So I wrote a previous post about how Netflix raised their prices for Blu-ray rental and how I might end up bouncing back to Blockbuster.

Well, one of the main reasons for me to use Blockbuster went away this week, as they closed the store that was about a 1/4 mile from my house. They posted so nicely that they're not leaving the "neighborhood" but just moving... about 5 miles away.

I can't wait until someone starts streaming movies in full 1080p HD with 7.1 digital surround. (Yes, Netflix streams movies, and the video isn't too bad, but I didn't buy a surround sound system to listen in 2 channel. Movies are an AUDIO/visual experience)
