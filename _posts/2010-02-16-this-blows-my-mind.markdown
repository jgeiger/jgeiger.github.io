There was a post a while ago about how Facebook users don't actually go to facebook.com to log in. They use the search field in their browsers for "facebook login" and just click on the first thing that pops up.

Here's the [blog post](http://mattstratton.com/hilarity/hundreds-of-facebook-users-are-apparently-really-dumb) where I found this.

Here's the [actual page](http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/facebook_wants_to_be_your_one_true_login.php).

No wonder there are massive bot nets and phishing scams and email spams going every day. People are just... wow.
