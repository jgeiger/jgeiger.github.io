I'm not sure what's so great about the 3Gs. I liked my Apple IIgs, which I've still got, but the new iPhone just makes me go, eh.

I think it's kinda dumb that Apple released the 3.0 software for the 3G, but didn't include the voice control. You gave us the voice memo bit, so it clearly has the ability to record voice and process it, so why cripple the software for your older phone?

I like my iPhone, but I'm not going to buy a new one every year (and pay full price) just for a few sidegrades. Give me video conferencing with a front facing camera. Then again, it may all be ATT's fault, considering that we can't even get MMS at launch.
