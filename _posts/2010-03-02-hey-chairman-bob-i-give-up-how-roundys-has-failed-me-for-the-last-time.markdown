Every week I go to the Pick N' Save in Brookfield at 15170 W. Greenfield Avenue.

Every week I buy milk.

Every week I take a milk gallon up to the front desk that has a "Sell By" date that has passed. This week I took one up that was SIX DAYS past the sell by date. I've been doing this for the last 3 months EVERY WEEK. I've been told by the managers on multiple occasions, "We'll fix it". I was told once they hired a new Dairy manager to deal with it.

I give up. I'm going to [Sendiks Fine Foods](http://www.sendiksfinefoods.com/).
