Why is it there are movies in my queue that are listed as "very long wait". That makes no sense. I'm in a QUEUE, first come, first served. Are there separate queues for each of the movies?

A better way to describe this would be "High member interest", since even if there are a lot of people interested in the movie, it's a luck of the draw for who gets it first.

Or is there a hidden queue? Netflix?
