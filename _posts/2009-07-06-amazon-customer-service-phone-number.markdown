I had an odd question about an item I recently purchased, and instead of blindly accepting the return policy, I wanted to call them and ask if it would be possible. The problem is, if you look all around the Amazon site, you can't really find a phone number. Google is your friend, and since you may have come here from a google search, I will post it for you as well.

**US Customer Service**
