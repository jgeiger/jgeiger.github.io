I started looking into moving off of dreamhost because I've had some issues with responsiveness on my applications. For $20 a year, I could put up with it. Now that I'm paying $100, it's a bit more annoying since there are other options out there at that price point.

I'm considering [slicehost.com](http://www.slicehost.com/), [linode.com](http://www.linode.com/) and [webfaction.com](http://www.webfaction.com/).

I guess the other big reason is that I want to play with MongoDB and each of these gives me that option.
