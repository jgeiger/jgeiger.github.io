And while it was really good in season one, I think every season since then has flopped. I think Season two was the low point.

Why did it fail?

It failed because it never lived up to the single scene where "Future Hiro" met with Peter in the subway. This single scene set up so much of what could have been great about the show, and instead they turned Hiro into a clown, and Peter into a limited power moron.

TV needs to start accepting shows with specifically limited runs so they can cut out all the crap and just have episodes of excellent. Notice how Lost got good again when they set the end date. Dollhouse, for is spectacularly bad beginning, became brilliant when they stopped doing the "story of the week" and focused on the downfall of the tech and corporation.

TV executives need to find people with brilliant ideas, give them a show that will ONLY last 1-2 seasons, but give them the ability to make more than one series. The audience will follow great storytelling, even if it's not the same characters.
