So, I was originally a Blockbuster online subscriber when they had a very nice setup, something like $20 for 3 movies out with unlimited exchanges in store, and 2 coupons for free rentals in store that could be used for games as well. Blockbuster decided that they were providing a too good of a deal, and raised the price, removed the coupons and generally did a bunch of stuff that made me want out.

I looked into netflix, which was just starting to offer free online streaming, and since I have a 360, it seemed like it might be a good deal. I signed up, $12.99 a month with $1 for blu-ray access. While I'm not sure I like the idea of a premium for blu-ray, I decided to deal with it.

Cut to yesterday. It seems that netflix decided that providing blu-ray movies is worth charging those users more money. My current plan will jump to $16.99/mo, 2 movies out at a time, unlimited mail exchanges per month.

Blockbuster's 2 a month unlimited mail exchange plan is $16.99/mo, no blu-ray premium (you get them by default) AND here's the bonus: 3 in-store exchanges per month.

Netflix, unless something changes very quickly, you've lost me as a customer, since you're not providing the same value for my money.
