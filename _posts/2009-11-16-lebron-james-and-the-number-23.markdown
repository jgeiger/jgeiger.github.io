I appreciate why he's trying to do this, but really as I read somewhere, why stop there? Too many numbers in the NBA have an iconic meaning.

In the end, if you think about it, isn't it to his benefit, for two reasons, to change is number?

1. Anyone seeing him play now, will still see 23 and think MJ. You can put it on "respect" but either way, it's still "remember me, not him".

2. Jersey sales. Hello? Who isn't going to buy a LeBron 6 if you're a fan? Get your Cleveland 6, and soon enough, your "insert team with the most money" 6.
