I got a Prius. I like it. It has no idea how much fuel is in the tank. I drive till the dash tells me it's empty. I go to fill the tank. It's a 11 gallon tank, but even when it's WARNING me it's empty, I can only put in 8 gallons. Why is it cars in the 70's with no tech can do a better job with alerting me how much fuel is in the car?
