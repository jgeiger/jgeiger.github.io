I shop at Pick n' Save and I bring along my own bags. I bought them at Sam's club. They are very large, and generally my whole weekly trip fits in two bags. I usually get a credit of $0.05 per bag. It <del>is</del> was a nice bonus.

I was informed by a cashier last weekend that the credit will ONLY go to people using bags SOLD by Pick n' Save with their logo on them.  I can be "green" and be rewarded but only if I choose to use your bags? You don't get it. I don't do it for the nickle. I'm guessing most people aren't doing it for the nickle either, but to say "You're not worth supporting in your effort because you didn't FUND our efforts ahead of time" is just dumb.

I figured maybe the cashier was wrong, so I emailed Roundy's corporate. Here's the response. (My emphasis)



> Mr. Or Ms. Geiger,
