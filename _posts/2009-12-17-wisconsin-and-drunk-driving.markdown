I am embarrassed to be a resident of this state.

We're just now passing a bill that makes your FIRST offense a crime? (and only if you have someone younger than 16 in the vehicle) And... after the FOURTH, that's right 4 times, a felony.

Who is possibly thinking anything less than felony on the 2nd offense, and permanent loss of your driver's license on the 3rd offense is acceptable?

How do our representatives get told to make these toothless laws? Oh, maybe because some of them have been arrested SEVEN times for DUI. And he thinks he deserves to keep his job...

The is NO EXCUSE for driving after drinking. If you need to drive, don't drink before doing it. If you need to drink, then don't drive afterward. It's just that simple.
