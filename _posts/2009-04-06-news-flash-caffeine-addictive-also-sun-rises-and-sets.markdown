> Researchers at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, **recognized the condition as a disorder five years ago** after reviewing decades of studies. They concluded the higher the caffeine intake, the more likely a patient was to suffer from severe withdrawal symptoms when denied the ingredient.



So, it was discovered 5 years ago that caffeine had withdrawal symptoms? Really? No one thought to ask the millions of people who get headaches when they don't get their daily intake?

I knew it was an issue when I quit drinking soda after high-school and had crazy headaches for weeks.
