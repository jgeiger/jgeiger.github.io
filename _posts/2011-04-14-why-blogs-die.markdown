From lack of posting. I just went through my google reader account and removed about 15-20 rails blogs that haven't had a post in over a year. Then I thought about my own blog and realized I haven't been posting at all. Maybe it's because I don't have a lot to post, but I do think it's important that there is at least something there.

Hopefully I'll be able to do more updates.
